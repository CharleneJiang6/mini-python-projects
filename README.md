## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git https://github.com/CharleneJiang6/mini-python-projects.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to a folder of interest:**
   ```bash
   cd graphic_calculator
   ```
3. **Run the script:**
   - Most scripts can be run with:
     ```bash
     python script_name.py
     ```
   - Some folders may contain data files (e.g., `.csv`, `.xlsx`) or images required for the code to work.

4. **Read any comments or docstrings** in each script for usage details.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Some scripts may require additional packages (e.g., `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`). Install packages as needed.
